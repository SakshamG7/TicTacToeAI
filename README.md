# Saksham's Custom Neural Network Implementation for a Tic Tac Toe AI!
### Pure Python, Basically no external libraries.
The AIs will play against each other and learn from their mistakes, no data collection, just play!
not sure if this will work, but its worth a try!

This could be repurposed for chess now that I think about it :)

I Think a better fitness function, based on the median or something would be a better measure of the model's performance, as we have to trust that the latest model is the best, since it would make more draws over time, thus having a lower fitness than the previous round. Perhaps using ELO instead?
